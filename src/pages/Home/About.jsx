            Hello, our beloved customers ♡
          </h2>

          <p className="lead mb-4">
            My name is <strong>VenLong</strong>, and I’m truly so happy you’re here reading this.
          </p>

          <p className="fs-5 mb-4 lh-lg">
            I’m the co-owner of <strong>SNE Cafe</strong> — our little warm corner in Phnom Penh where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee meets the sweetest smiles. 
            This cafe was born from a dream: to create a cozy space where every cup tells a story, every pastry is made with love, and every guest feels like family.
          </p>

          <p className="fs-5 mb-4 lh-lg">
            We’re a women-owned and women-run cafe, proudly serving the finest locally sourced beans, homemade Khmer-inspired desserts, and your favorite comforting drinks. 
            We’re also always looking to collaborate with local artisans and small Cambodian businesses — because supporting each other is what community is all about.
          </p>

          <p className="fs-5 mb-5 lh-lg">
            Our team pours their heart into every latte, every smile, and every moment you spend with us. 
            We hope Glisten Blossom becomes your happy place — where you come not just for coffee, but for warmth, connection, and a little daily magic.
          </p>

          <p className="fs-5 fst-italic mb-4">
            Your thoughts mean the world to me — good or bad, I genuinely want to hear them.<br />
            Come say hi, or reach out anytime ♡
          </p>

          <p className="fw-bold mb-2">
            With love,
            Venlong
